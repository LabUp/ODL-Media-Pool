# Donate Your Dusty Device
*Promotional Business Cards*

Please grab these files, send them over to your favourite print service and spread the word on paper about our "Donate Your Dusty Device" (DYDD) campaign.

The size of these cards is 85mm x 55mm (common European business card size), you should easily find a manufacturer for that. And they're usually quite unexpensive.
