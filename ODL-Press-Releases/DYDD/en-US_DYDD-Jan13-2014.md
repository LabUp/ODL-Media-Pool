Do not release before January 13, 2014

# Donate Your Dusty Device
*Put your old devices to good use*

*Start clutter-free into the new year - and help Open Device Labs (ODLs) around the globe with their initiative "Donate Your Dusty Device" via their website http://OpenDeviceLab.com/DYDD.*

*Open Device Labs (ODLs) are shared community pools of internet connected devices such as smartphones, tablets, or consoles, and are open for developers to test their websites and smartphone apps.*

If you just got yourself a new smartphone or tablet and are looking for a helpful new use for your old device, consider donating it to an Open Device Lab. Over 90 Labs have been established already at locations all over the globe. Everyone benefits from access to a free device testing pool - including donators.

Websites or apps unfortunately do not always work as expected, especially across mobile devices. Worldwide, there are around 20,000 different models, and about 15 new devices are released every week. Each variant of a device is unique and comes with its own technical quirks and hurdles. Having access to these varied devices, both modern and older, is often difficult. This poses problems to developers creating new content. This often results in quality assurance being reduced in priority, with websites often not tested against enough real devices.

As a comparison: car manufacturers calculate a significant portion of cost of a car for testing purposes. But when it comes to the production of digital experiences, budget cuts are very likely to hit the test budgets first. People who support ODLs with device donations are supporting local and international developers and their users, independent of manufacturers or brands.

If you just decided to get rid of some clutter by supporting an Open Device Lab, go to http://OpenDeviceLab.com/DYDD now. Only three easy steps separate your functional old device from a meaningful new existence for the greater good.
